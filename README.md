The Weather Forecasting System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to offer users real-time weather information for a specified location. The system is equipped with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input the name of a city and retrieve detailed weather updates with just a click. Upon entering a city name and clicking the "Get Weather" button, the system fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can quickly access crucial information such as the current temperature, weather description, wind speed, and humidity. Additionally, the system provides a 5-day forecast, displaying key details like temperature and weather description for each day at 12:00 PM. The application also enhances user engagement by dynamically updating the background image based on the prevailing weather conditions, creating an immersive experience. With a well-designed layout featuring a navigation bar, header, and footer, the system offers seamless navigation. Furthermore, the inclusion of Firebase authentication in the Login page ensures secure access, allowing users to log in using their email and password. The application extends its functionality with a feedback form, enabling users to share their thoughts and suggestions. The footer conveniently provides contact information for the Weather Forecasting System. In essence, this project combines functionality and aesthetics to deliver an intuitive and informative weather forecasting experience to users.
